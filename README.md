### Refund Policy
**Wrong purchase/Change of mind**

Due to the impossibility of us investigating these reasons, we are unable to offer refunds for these reasons.

We recommend that you consider looking at other people's reviews before you buy.

**Bugs**

Refund requests due to bugs will be refunded if we are unable to fix them within one month.

Please report the bug first on Discord or Twitter. Without the help of our users, it may be difficult for us to fix the bug.

If a tweak causes a crash, it is mandatory to submit a crash log for it.

We also reserve the right to refuse a refund in the unlikely event that the bug is specific to your device, caused by another tweak, or caused by software designed to crack it.

Also, due to the way this tweak works, the app may be forced to quit due to lack of memory if a large number of apps are windowed. This is unlikely to happen in general use, but this is a specification.
